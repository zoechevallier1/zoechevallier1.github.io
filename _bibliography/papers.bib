  abstract = {This paper proposes a software architecture for creating and
managing unambiguous descriptions of a Smart Building, allowing its
Digital Twin to be deployed. These descriptions include static semantic
structural description and dynamic time-series sensors data. Moreover,
it is designed to be able to include data from various simulation tools,
represented in the same way as sensors data. Thus, relying on these de-
scriptions allow easy implementations of both monitoring and interaction
tools that can the be interfaced with the Smart Building. Before the re-
cent emergence of Smart Buildings, there was very few advantages in
applying this concept to the field of construction and building manage-
ment. Non-connected buildings don’t produce real-time data, and can’t
be monitored nor operated from computer systems. But now that more
and more buildings include IoT devices that allow them to expose data
and services, the benefits of creating a Digital Twin to interact with
the building, without interrogating the object itself, only by querying
its Digital Twin, appears obvious. It then becomes crucial to be able to
expose both a static description of the building’s components (includ-
ing IoT devices structural and functional description) and dynamic data
that represent the evolution of the building’s states over time.}
